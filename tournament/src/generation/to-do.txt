What I need to do:
1. Generate all the sets
2. Calculate the game numbers of those sets
3. Position the games correctly
4. Calculate the seeds and placeholders of all games (might need to do this before the positions)
5. Make API to edit the games and tournament
6. Devise method to make 3rd/4th place game, 5th/6th/7th/8th place game, etc.
7. Do everything else in the checklist (including triple elimination)

3 distinct patterns:
2^(e-2) + 2^(e-1) < p <= 2^e:               From 25 - 32 (stable losers)
2^(e-3) + 2^(e-1) < p <= 2^(e-2) + 2^(e-1): From 21 - 24 (semi-stable losers)
2^(e-1) < p <= 2^(e-3) + 2^(e-1):           From 17 - 20 (unstable losers)

Unstable tier:
first round (and hence second round) losers games have two game number patterns, both go from biggest to smallest, and interweave with each other,
based off the game number of the loser in the top spot in the set, Example:
120 L107

119 L106
60  L50

118 L104
59  L49


Unstable tier is divided into 2 as well (top half is stable, bottom half is unstable)
Top half: second interweaved game numbers are for the sets at visual full positions of double the non-byes


EVERYTHING IS ORDERED BY THE FIRST BRACKET SECOND ROUND, BYES ARE WHAT CAUSE THE "INTERWEAVE"
